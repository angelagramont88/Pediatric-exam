                category: "cardio",
                type: "multiple",
                question: "A newborn infant is diagnosed with Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA). Which medication should the nurse anticipate administering to close the PDA?",
                options: [
                    "Digoxin",
                    "Indomethacin",
                    "Furosemide",
                    "Prostaglandin E1"
                ],
                correct: [1],
                rationale: "Indomethacin or ibuprofen are used to help close a PDA by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis, which promotes closure of the ductus arteriosus. These medications work like 'glue' to seal the opening. Digoxin is used for heart failure, furosemide is a diuretic, and prostaglandin E1 actually KEEPS the ductus open (opposite effect)."
            },

                id: 2,
                category: "cardio",

                question: "A nurse is caring for an infant with Tetralogy of Fallot who is experiencing a 'Tet spell.' What is the PRIORITY nursing intervention?",
                options: [
                    "Start oxygen immediately",
                    "Place the infant in knee-chest position",
                    "Administer IV fluids",
                    "Call the healthcare provider"
                ],
                correct: [1],
                rationale: "During a Tet spell (hypercyanotic episode), placing the infant in knee-chest position is the PRIORITY because it increases systemic vascular resistance and decreases right-to-left shunting, improving oxygenation. While oxygen and other interventions are important, positioning comes first. The infant may naturally squat or pull knees to chest - this is a normal compensatory mechanism and should NOT be prevented."

                options: [
                    "Ventricular septal defect (VSD)",
                    "Pulmonary stenosis",
                    "Overriding aorta",
                    "Right ventricular hypertrophy",
                    "Atrial septal defect (ASD)"
                ],
                correct: [0, 1, 2, 3],
                rationale: "Tetralogy of Fallot has FOUR defects (tetra = 4): VSD, pulmonary stenosis, overriding aorta, and right ventricular hypertrophy. ASD is NOT part of Tetralogy of Fallot. Remember the four components that make this a 'decreased pulmonary blood flow' disorder that results in cyanosis."

                question: "A nurse is preparing to administer digoxin to a 6-month-old infant. The apical pulse is 85 bpm. What should the nurse do?",
                options: [
                    "Administer the medication as ordered",
                    "Hold the medication and notify the provider",
                    "Give half the ordered dose",
                    "Recheck the pulse in 30 minutes"
                ],
                correct: [1],
                rationale: "The medication should be held and the provider notified. Digoxin should be withheld if the heart rate is less than 110 bpm in infants. The threshold is <90 bpm for young children and <70 bpm for older children. A heart rate of 85 bpm in an infant is below the safety threshold and could indicate digoxin toxicity."

                question: "A child with congestive heart failure is being monitored. Which findings would the nurse expect? (Select all that apply)",
                options: [
                    "Edema of face, hands, and feet",
                    "Weight loss",
                    "Tachycardia",

                    "Bradycardia"
                ],
                correct: [0, 2, 3],
                rationale: "In CHF, expect edema (fluid retention), tachycardia (compensatory mechanism), and decreased urine output (kidneys not getting enough blood). Weight GAIN occurs (not loss) due to fluid retention - this is why DAILY WEIGHTS are a priority. Bradycardia is not expected; tachycardia occurs as the heart tries to compensate for poor pumping."

                id: 6,
                category: "cardio",

                question: "Which congenital heart defect would require administration of Prostaglandin E1 to maintain patency of the ductus arteriosus?",
                options: [
                    "Ventricular septal defect (VSD)",
                    "Atrial septal defect (ASD)",
                    "Tricuspid atresia",
                    "Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)"
                ],
                correct: [2],
                rationale: "Tricuspid atresia requires prostaglandin E1 to keep the ductus arteriosus OPEN because the tricuspid valve is completely closed - without the PDA or PFO, blood cannot flow properly and the baby will die. Prostaglandin E1 is used for 'ductal-dependent' lesions. VSD and ASD have holes but don't need the ductus. PDA is when we want to CLOSE the ductus, not keep it open."
